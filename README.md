cv-resume
=========

This repo contains my résumé in non-interactive and interactive form (coming soon!).

Normally I would not include the output file (the pdf) but in the interests of using this repository as a poor man's dropbox for submitting the application I have done so.

The resume itself is built using Scribus and the SVG logos have been variously borrowed from wikipedia and the company's own (publicly available) sites.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my résumé!
